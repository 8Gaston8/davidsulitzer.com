              I’m French and English, born near Paris, educated in the UK, and now

              B2C and B2B, building mobile apps with tens of thousands of monthly
              active users — and I now run an AI-native PM system where agents

              I treat AI coding agents like my dev team. I write the specs, set

              They do the building, testing, and deployment choreography. I stay

              <p>
                I’m the product mind, the agents are the hands. I obsess over
                user impact, clarity, and sequencing. The agents turn that into
                working code and proof.

                QA. Nothing ships without a human gate.

                workflow refinements — the same product rigor as any feature.

              execute the repetitive work. It’s not “future of work” — it’s how

              <p>
                I've codified every repeating PM workflow — from issue creation
                to release management — into structured markdown playbooks that
                AI coding agents execute autonomously. Each skill is a multi-step,
                deeply detailed instruction set covering edge cases, error
                handling, verification steps, and quality gates. They span issue
                creation (with cross-platform dependency management via GraphQL),
                QA (a 5-phase server pipeline and adaptive iOS workflow), release
                management (with a custom App Stability Score from 6 weighted
                metrics), bug triage (visual screenshot analysis from Slack),
                crash triage, deployment orchestration, and release notes
                generation.

                CONDUCTOR is a GitHub Action I built that runs hourly during work
                hours. It surveys both iOS and server repos, prioritizes work
                (review comments → CI failures → merge conflicts → server issues
                → iOS issues), and posts saved replies to trigger AI coding
                agents. It has safeguards: max 5 in-flight PRs, circuit breaker
                logic, attempt counting, and 3 modes (survey, dry-run, execute).
                My backlog literally works itself.

                Nothing reaches users without my review. AI agents create PRs
                and run QA, but PRs stay as drafts until I personally verify.
                For UI changes, I build in Xcode and visually inspect every
                pixel. For logic changes, I review the diff. I define the
                quality bar, the agents meet it — and when they don't, they
                iterate until they do.

                metric — it's embedded in every AI skill file. Every issue gets
                a funnel-stage label (Acquisition, Activation, Conversion,
                Retention). Every release gets a "Metrics Impact" analysis.
                Leading indicators (Activation Rate, Early Retention, Investment
                Rate) are referenced in the skill instructions themselves,
                ensuring every piece of work traces back to what matters.
